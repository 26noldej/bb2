## BEFORE YOU USE INSECURLY
bypassi has found yet another awesome exploit,
both links are [here](https://skiovox.com) and [here](https://github.com/bypassiwastaken/skiovox). this exploit allows you to go into a browser in kiosk mode and install ANY extension you want and do anything you want. please consider this before insecurly, as it always works and is working on every version (you must have kiosk apps)

Hello ur prob here to disable dumb "secure"ly. lucky for you i have delivered. 

<hr>

step 1. get the bookmarklet [here](https://github.com/zek-c/extension-v111-kill/blob/main/bookmarklet.js) or go to [My Website](https://zekcurly.netlify.app) for easy drag and drop to bookmarks bar

<hr>

step 2. put it in a bookmark

<hr>

step 3. go to [Securly ðŸ¤“](https://securly.com)

<hr>

step 4. click the bookmark and an "OFF" button will appear. Click this and it will turn on the Securly killer (Which last forever, no need to re enable) and Click it again to turn it off.

<hr>

This will hard disable securly. It wont disable the extension, but corrupt the cookies. it will remove the blocking string it adds to the source code of websites it blocks. it sets the cookies to expire in like the year 5000 so you clearly wont ever need to enabke this again unless you clear ur cookies
