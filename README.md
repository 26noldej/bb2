Hello ur prob here to disable dumb "secure"ly. lucky for you i have delivered. 

<hr>

step 1. get the bookmarklet [here](https://github.com/zek-c/extension-v111-kill/blob/main/bookmarklet.js) or go to [My Website](https://killcurly.netlify.app) for easy drag and drop to bookmarks bar

<hr>

step 2. put it in a bookmark

<hr>

step 3. go to [Securly ðŸ¤“](https://securly.com)

<hr>

step 4. click the bookmark and an "OFF" button will appear. Click this and it will turn on the Securly killer (Which last forever, no need to re enable) and Click it again to turn it off.

<hr>

This will hard disable securly. It wont disable the extension, but corrupt the cookies. it will remove the blocking string it adds to the source code of websites it blocks.
